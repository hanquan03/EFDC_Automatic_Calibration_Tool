# EFDC_Automatic_Calibration_Tool
The EFDC model is an important tool for surface hydrodynamics and water environment simulation. However, the complex model structure, high parameter dimension, and expensive running time cost make it difficult to achieve automatic model calibration of the EFDC model. In this project, we provide an "EFDC_Automatic_Calibration_Tool" (EACT) to realize the model automatic calibration and uncertainty quantification for the EFDC model. The project consists of three parts. The code "1_Objective Function" is used to build EFDC models in batches, automatically perform model calculations, and calculate the objective function. The code "2_Posterior Distribution" is used to update the posterior distribution of EFDC hydrodynamic model parameters and to provide mapping services. The code "3_Spatial uncertainty" integrates the simulation results satisfying behavioral parameter sets and evaluates the spatial uncertainty of all outputs.
